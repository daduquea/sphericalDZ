# SHREC'20 Challenge: sphericalDZ
This repository contains the required code to predict the labels of a point cloud using our proposed method for SHREC'20 challenge. The input of the model is a spherical projection of the point cloud with already detected ground using quasi flat zones algorithm from BEV projections [1]
